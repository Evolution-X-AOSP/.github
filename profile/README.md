Welcome to Evolution X!

Evolution X aims to personify the OS included with Google's latest Pixel devices while integrating features from the custom ROMs that we know and love.

Now that you know about us, now what?

Help bring us to your device! Spread Evolution X around! The more devices we support, the happier everyone will be!

### Where to start

Check out the following repositories:

- [Manifest](https://github.com/Evolution-X/manifest)
- [Vendor](https://github.com/Evolution-X/vendor_evolution)
- [Evolution-X-Devices](https://github.com/Evolution-X-Devices)

After visiting the said repositories, familiarize yourself with the different repos we track so that issues can be lessened with proper PRs.

1. If you plan on building for your device, make sure to adapt your tree to our configurations. You may use [this commit](https://github.com/Evolution-X-Devices/device_xiaomi_raphael/commit/1ad0de2a72ba9c9e846ac04b9c632c98560decb0) as a reference.
2. Using a dependencies file is suggested but not required. You may manually clone/replace all the repos that your device tree may require.
3. Make sure to use the ```mka evolution``` command to start your build.
